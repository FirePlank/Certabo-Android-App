# Certabo Board Intergration
I made this project to help people easily be able to communicate and play on their certabo boards
since the apps that the certabo team made don't have that much functionality.
<br/><br/>
The server folder contains the code you need to run on your computer to access certain functions like
being able to play against the engine and on chess.com
<br/><br/>
The client folder contains the kivy app that you can run on your phone or the computer if you wish.
It has functionality such as:

- Intergration with lichess.org and chess.com (playing on chess.com requires the server to be running)
- Solve puzzles (not yet implemented)
- Study openings from your own made lichess studies
- Play against the engine (not yet implemented)
- Play against other human opponents and save/export the games to PGN and lichess for post-game analysis
  
NOTE: if you want to run the app on your phone, you might need an adapter to be able to connect the USB-A port to your phone and start communicating.
